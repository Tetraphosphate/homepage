I loved the sound of this instrument and I really enjoyed doing it and as a result of that I did it a lot. You know, often times when my friends were out playing football and baseball I would be in playing scales, playing my major scales, practicing my scales and eventually, you know, after a year or two of steady daily practice my sound improved, I started being able to play in tune a little better and my facility on the instrument, my slide technique got better and better and it actually started getting fun after lots of daily consistent practice.
